# Final degree thesis project
The purpose of this repository is to contain the source code for my final degree thesis project at Universitat Politècnica de València.

The main idea revolves around developing a set of libraries/modules for the real-time operating system **FreeRTOS** that add support for
mode changes in multi-mode systems.
